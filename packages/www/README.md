# Fastly Bun Simple

A simple example project showcasing Fastly Compute@Edge, Bun, and Hono.

## Setup

```
bun install
bun dev
```

```
open http://localhost:7676
```

```
bun deploy
```

### Vite

```
bun vite
```

Vite mode allows you to develop with HMR. It's great for rapid development, but it's still best to check your work compiles with `bun dev`

Note: not all fastly plugins are added to vite.
